ECE 445
A project by Mateusz Chorazy, Debjit Das, and Ian Fitzgerald

This project would not have been possible without Debjit's creativity and artistic vision.

Performing artists are limited in their ability to control a venueâ€™s lighting in real-time. They rely on
light designers to operate complicated and expensive control equipment and are almost never
directly involved in the real-time controls. Our gesture based light control system introduces a
new medium through which artists can add a new visual component to their performances. With
just the movement of their body, a performing artist can directly control industry standard
moving head lights in real-time.
